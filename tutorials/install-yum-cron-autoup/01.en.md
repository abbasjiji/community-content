## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to enable automatic updating in CentOS/RHEL.

**Prerequisites**
* Server with Linux operating system (CentOS/RHEL distribution)
* SSH
  * Putty (Windows)
  * OpenSSH (Linux/MacOS)
* Root access
* `yum-cron` Package

## Step 1 - Installing yum-cron Package

We will use the yum-cron package to automatically update the operating system. The yum-cron package provides a convenient way to check for, download and apply updates automatically.

Install the package with the following command:
```
yum install yum-cron
```

## Step 2 - Enabling yum-cron Service

The following commands will enable the yum-cron service to start automatically when booting the operating system:

* CentOS/RHEL 7.x
```
systemctl enable yum-cron.service
```

* CentOS/RHEL 6.x
```
chkconfig yum-cron on
```

### Step 2.1 - Starting yum-cron Service

Using the following commands to start the yum-cron service:

* CentOS/RHEL 7.x
```
systemctl start yum-cron.service
```

* CentOS/RHEL 6.x
```
service yum-cron start
```


## Conclusion

Your operating system's packages will now be automatically updated every day.
